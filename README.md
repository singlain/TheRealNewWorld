> _If you want something done right - do it yourself._ The driving force behind this modpack. Being a spiritual successor of my previous, long forgotten, two year old modpack I made for a server with friends - **The Real New World** was remade from ground up for **NeoForge** and had saved most of the charm from its predecessor, along with some changes and additions - those being:
- **Balance and Progression Changes**
- **Sound and Atmosphere Overhauls**
- **Difficulty and Combat Overhauls**
- **Transportation Rebalance**
- **...and more!**

## Notes
- Make sure to allocate at least **4GB of RAM** to your instance!
- Balancing and testing is **still ongoing**.
- Chunk load times are **_slow_**.
- Users with lower-end hardware may experience severe stuttering and server lag during first 10 to 20 minutes of gameplay due to terrain around generating.

## Balance and Progression Changes

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

> One of the primary focuses of this modpack was rebalance and progression; this modpack changes plenty of aspects of the vanilla game that were previously too overpowered so that players can consider also enjoying other aspects of the game.
## Villager Trade Rebalance
The [Villager Trade Rebalance](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Villager_Trade_Rebalance) experiment available in the world creation settings is now enabled by default. Among other balancing changes, you'll have to get over not being able to get 1-emerald deals or the best enchantment in the game available within the first 5 minutes of gameplay. From now on, get ready for those joys to be another milestone to achieve.
## 80% Abandoned Villages
Adding insult to injury - finding a village that wasn't massacred by a wave of zombies or a raid will now be a challenge; Now, either breed new types of villagers to get the desired Mending book, or reside to a good old adventure throughout the wonderful new world!
## End Remastered
Thanks to [End Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/endrem), even if you are able to locate the stronghold with an ender portal, you may no longer use the regular Eyes of Ender. Instead you'll have to explore the world's structures, finding the special eyes added by this mod to then use them in the End Portal instead. Cherry on top - you can't use an eye of one kind twice in the same End Portal! Travel the world and appreciate it's beauty - good luck!

</details>

## Difficulty and Combat Overhauls

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

## Dungeon Difficulty
[Dungeon Difficulty](https://modrinth.com/mod/dungeon-difficulty) will make every dungeon you visit a challenge, no matter what gear you wear or how well you enchant it! But trust me - the reward is worth it.
## Combat Overhaul
Thanks to the marvelous [Better Combat](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-combat) mod, along with a fitting weapons from [Basic Weapons](https://modrinth.com/mod/basicweapons), fleshed out with the fine-tuned [Combat Nouveau](https://modrinth.com/mod/combat-nouveau) and further tweaking by yours truly, you get an amazing balance of fun and challenge, while maintaining the simplicity of the combat from Vanilla! Also, thanks to [Amendments](https://modrinth.com/mod/amendments), you can now throw Fireballs and Dragon Fireball (which are now craftable!).
## Tiny Skeletons
[Tiny Skeletons](https://modrinth.com/mod/tiny-skeletons/) adds a simple new mob - if there are baby zombies, why not baby skeletons?

</details>

## Transportation Rebalance

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

> Some ways of transportation, railways, for example, haven't been updated to fit the modern Minecraft, making them obsolete over other methods of transportation like ice boats or elytras, so let me propose a solution...
## Ice Boat Nerf
No more boats traveling at 50 blocks per second! Nugh-ugh!
## Darceno's Minecarts
While Create's Trains are a thing, they require a lot of effort and resources to build than the regular railway, so thanks to [Darceno's Minecarts](https://modrinth.com/datapack/darcenos-minecarts), minecarts can now reach twice their previous speed, making them a pretty viable transportation method!
## Horseman and the others
[Horseman](https://modrinth.com/mod/horseman), along with [Kaffee's Dual Ride](https://modrinth.com/mod/kaffees_dual_ride) and [AstikorCarts](https://modrinth.com/mod/astikorcarts-redux) eliminates most of the annoyances of owning a horse in Minecraft, so from now on:
- Horses can swim
- Horses can fit two people
- Horses can fit in boats
- Horses won't get stuck in leaves
- Horses can be used to transport goods and animals, along with an ability to quickly till fields using wagons from AstikorCarts.
- Tamed horses won't wander away and can be called to player using Copper Horns
- A special food item can make a tamed horse run 40% faster

</details>

## Worldgen Overhaul

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>


> A simple, yet delightful combo of [Tectonic](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tectonic) and [Geophilic](https://modrinth.com/datapack/geophilic), further tweaked to feature the most pleasant and vast terrain imaginable make your time around here much more enjoyable.

</details>

## Sound and Atmosphere Overhauls

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

> These two points were very precisely tweaked, to gather the best combination of mods that will transform Minecraft into something truly beautiful. There are too many to list, but among the main ones there are:

- [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons)
- [Dynamic Surroundings](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamicsurroundingsfabric)
- [Enchanced Visuals](https://modrinth.com/mod/enhancedvisuals)
- [Presence Footsteps](https://modrinth.com/mod/presence-footsteps)

</details>

## Create, Addons and Farmer's Delight

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>


> No modpack can live without these two these days, so on top of these two there are also some sweet additions:

- [Create Slice & Dice](https://modrinth.com/mod/slice-and-dice)
- [Create Bells & Whistles](https://modrinth.com/mod/bellsandwhistles)
- [Create Steam 'n' Rails (NeoForge)](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-steam-n-rails-1.21.1)

</details>

## Other Additions

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

- Thanks to [Amendments](https://modrinth.com/mod/6iTJugQR) and [Another Furniture](https://modrinth.com/mod/ulloLmqG) you'll have more functionality to the vanilla blocks and just a tiny amount of new decoration options to still keep you grounded and creative with your builds.
- [Easy Anvils](https://modrinth.com/mod/OZBR5JT5) and [Easy Magic](https://modrinth.com/mod/9hx3AbJM) make Enchanting and Repairing your tools much less of a struggle.
- ...and more! There are still plenty of subtle changes that weren't listed here, so why not go and see for yourself? =)
